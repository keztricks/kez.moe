                    <p>This is a little document to give those on my team an idea of what to
                        expect, it's based on
                        <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/">How to Rands</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Hello! If you're reading this then it probably means that I'm your line manager, 
                        lucky you, welcome to the team!</p>

                    <p><b>If you're new</b>, it takes a little time to get to know each other, and this document
                        isn't going to do that, but hopefully it will get us kick started.</p>

                    <p><b>If you've been on the team a while</b> then this is hopefully a good reference
                        for what you should be getting from me, so be sure to keep me honest!</p>
                    
                    <p><b>#000 Tea,</b> oat milk, no sugar.</p>

                    <h3>Hints for rookies</h3>

                    <p><b>#001 Take your time,</b> we don't expect you to set the world on fire on 
                        your first day, if you're here you're good enough to be here, chat to
                        people, see what they're up to, get up to speed with whats going on.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>#002 Take notes,</b> notes are great, you don't know what's important and
                        what's not when getting started, do yourself a favour, write it all down,
                        you'll thank yourself later!</p>

                    <p><b>#003 Ask questions,</b> we don't bite! We love it when you hit up Google
                        and solve your own problem, but we also love it when you ask us, and we get
                        to feel super cool by helping out. Our young team is full of people who
                        were in your shoes not to long ago, they're know how will be invaluable!</p>

                    <p id="004"><b>#004 Get involved,</b> be it in a group discussion, a table football
                        game, a lunch time run or Friday pub, whatever you fancy, we work super
                        hard, and we have a good time doing it.</p>

                    <p><b>#005 Don't bring lunch on Friday,</b> it's fish and chip Friday, and
                        lunch is on the company, <a href="http://redhot.fish">better get your order
                        in!</a></p>

                    <h3>Being on the Team</h3>

                    <p id="006"><b>#006 I'm available whenever,</b> okay, so I have some kind of a life, and
                        I might be in a meeting, or in the pub, but drop me a Slack message any
                        hour, when I see it I'll either be right there, or I'll arange a time.</p>

                    <p><b>#007 Sometimes I work daft hours <a href="#017">[#017]</a>, you don't have
                        too,</b> of course, I appreciate it when you go the 
                        extra mile <a href="#013">[#013]</a>, but it's a choice, if I message you
                        out of hours and it's not about an outage <a href="#013">[#013]</a>, don't
                        feel obliged to reply.</p>

                    <p><b>#009 We try hard to be super flexible,</b> take advantage of the
                        flexi-time policy, ask me if you want to work from home, so long as you're
                        getting work done, I'll probably say yes!</p>

                    <p><b>#010 1:1s are at least monthly,</b> probably more often if you're new to
                        the team. They can be as often as you like, or impromptu
                        <a href="#006">[#006]</a> if you or I have something to discuss.</p>

                    <h3>Kieran's Favourites</h3>

                    <p><b>#011 We work best when we're honest and open with each other,</b> in 1:1s
                        and day to day, I'll give my all to help us get the best out of each other.
                        To do this I hope you're open about how things are going. Honesty about
                        your performance, our performance, how you feel about work, helps us both
                        peroform at our best, and have a good time doing it.</p>

                    <p><b>#012 Soft skills are important,</b> we need good technical skills, we are
                        technical practicioners, but they are not the be all and end all, good
                        communication, personal management and teamwork are qualities required for
                        anybody working in our industry.</p>

                    <p id="013"><b>#013 I appreciate it when you go the extra mile,</b> learning
                        in your own time, working out of hours when there's a tight deadline or
                        downtime, joining in socially with the team <a href="#004">[#004]</a>.</p>

                    <p><b>#014 Mind your Ps & Qs,</b> I value politeness, ask don't tell, say
                        thanks, treat everyone you work with respect.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>#015 Keep me honest,</b> been too busy to help out a few times? moved
                        your 1:1 repeatedly? not gotten around to that thing I promissed? I'm a
                        human, and a busy one at that, tell me if I screw up, I'll get on it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Kieran's Quirks</h3>

                    <p><b>#016 I'm a bit daft,</b> okay, maybe I'm a lot daft, you don't need to
                        be serious to take work seriously, I appreciate a laugh, but I can probably
                        be a bit much, tell me to shut up if you'd like me to shut up!
                    </p>

                    <p id="017"><b>#017 I suffer from Crohns Disease,</b> this means that sometimes
                        I work around my body, starting early or late or working from home. If you
                        can't find me I'm probably in the loo! If I don't seem my usual self I'm
                        probably unwell. I don't like it beating me, and will work to make up.
                        <a href="https://www.crohnsandcolitis.org.uk/">Crohns and Colitis UK</a>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><b>#018 My initial opinion isn't usually what I settle on,</b> it can take
                        me some time to settle on an opinion or idea, this means I've refined my view,
                        not that I've forgotten what I said initially.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>#019 I'm good at finding a middle ground,</b> I feel a strength I have as
                        a manager is in keeping everyone happy, spinning preverbial plates and
                        finding a middle ground, this is how I like to work.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><b>#020 I am not good at confrontation,</b> if I feel I've upset, annoyed, or
                        otherwised inconvenienced someone it will play on my mind.</p>
